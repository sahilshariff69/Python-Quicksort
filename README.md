# Python Quick Sort Algorithm

This Python program demonstrates the Quick Sort algorithm to efficiently sort a given array of elements.

## Quick Sort Algorithm

The Quick Sort algorithm is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The process is applied recursively to the sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted.

The Python program defines a `quick_sort` function, which implements the Quick Sort algorithm.

## Usage

### Running the Program

To test the Quick Sort algorithm:

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python quick_sort.py

### Example

The provided Python script contains an example array (arr) that is sorted using the quick_sort function. You can replace this array with your own set of elements to observe the sorting.
